	Prometheus & Grafana 
				
	1. Kubernetes Monitoring Pods and Deployments using Prometheus & Grafana.

		- Install and Manage Prometheus & Grafana using Helm package Manager on Kubernetes_Cluster
		
	Pre-requisites:
	
		- Kubernetes 
			- Deploy the pods using Deployment Controller Objects
			- Access the Services running inside the pod using NodePort Service 
			- Upgrade/Downgrade the Application Image 
			- Scale-up/Down the No. of Pod instances 
			
		- Helm charts
			Helm ???
				- Package Manager for Kubernetes_Cluster.
				
				Linux Machines :
				
					apt-get 	- Install/Remove/Upgrade the Package 	- Debian/Ubuntu 
					yum 												- Centos/RHEL
					rpm 
					dnf 												- Fedora

	AWS DevOps Services ::::
	
		DevOps :::
		
			It is a Software Development Strategy which promotes the collaboration between the Teams like Development Team and Operations Teams to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment, Continuous Monitoring in more automated fashion.
			
			
			
		SDLC Process :
		Teams :::
		
			DevOps-Team 
				Infra-Structure Management Team 		--> Terraform,Ansible
				Application Development Team 			--> IDEs, Sonarlint, GIT/GITHUB, Jenkins 
				Testing Team 							--> Jenkins, Selenium/Selenium-Grid,TestNG,JUNIT
				Release Management Team 				--> Jenkins,Ansible,Docker,Kubernetes
				Production Support/Monitoring Team 		--> Prometheus/Grafana
				Security Administration Team 			--> Code-Quality Analyzer Tools - SonarQube
				
		
		DevOps based on three factors :
		
			- People 
			- Process 
			- Tools 
			
		
		DevOps Tools ::
		
			Open-Source DevOps Tools :
			
				GIT,GITHUB,Jenkins,Docker,Kubernetes,Ansible,Terraform,Prometheus,Grafana
			
			
			Managed Services(Licensed Product)
				- Cloud Service Providers and Verified Vendor Products - DevOps Tools and Services 
				
				
				AWS 	--> AWS Code Commit, Code Build, Code Deploy, Code Artifacts, Code Pipeline
				Azure	--> Azure DevOps Services - AzBoards,AzRepo,AzPipeline,AzTest,AzArtifact 
				GCP 	--> DevOps Service
			
		
			
			Detailed DevOps Assessment :
			
			AWS DevOps Services ::::
			
				AWS 	--> AWS Code Commit(GITHUB), Code Build(Jenkins), Code Deploy, Code Artifacts, Code Pipeline(Jenkins)
				
				AWS Services :
				
					EC2 
					
					S3 
					
					IAM 
					
					AWS DevOps Services :
						AWS Code Commit, Code Build, Code Deploy, Code Artifacts, Code Pipeline
						
					ECS,ECR(dockerhub),EKS 
					
					
			Manage Application Source Code ::::
			
				AWS Code Commit :
				
			AWS DevOps Services ::::	
			
				AWS strongly recommend to avail the AWS DevOps Services as IAM User. NOT as a root user.
				
				
				Create IAM User Account_ID on AWS Platform 
				
				
				
			GIT Module :::
			
				Github Repositories ::
					git bash / Terminal ?
					
					Visual Studio Code IDE ?
					
					
					
					https://git-codecommit.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/dcpwe-javaapp-repo1
					
					
				Distributed Version Control System :::
				
					Local Machine 							Remote Server
						Local git Repositories					Remote git Repositories
					
						git client								GIT Based tool 
																(github)
																	branches and perform parallel development
																	
																gitlab 
																bitbucket
																aws code commit 
																azure repository
																
						IDEs - Integrated Development Environment 

						Eclipse IDE 		- Develop the Code, integrate the code to remote repositories(github/aws-codecommit)
						Pycharm 
						IntelliJ
						VSC
